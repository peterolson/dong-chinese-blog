We've rolled out two new features recently, study lists and discussions.<br><br>
[![Study lists](/images/lists.PNG)](https://www.dong-chinese.com/lists)[![Discussion thread](/images/discuss.png)](https://www.dong-chinese.com/discuss)

## Discussions

When you are doing a lesson and have a question about a sentence, there is now a "Discuss" button that you can use to ask your question.

You can browse the discussions and create new posts at [https://www.dong-chinese.com/discuss](https://www.dong-chinese.com/discuss).

## Study lists

If you are studying for a specific test or want to work on learning a specific set of words, you can customize this at [https://www.dong-chinese.com/lists](https://www.dong-chinese.com/lists) or in the "Study lists" section of the settings page.
