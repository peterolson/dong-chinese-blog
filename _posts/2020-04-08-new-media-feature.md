[On the Dong Chinese media page](https://www.dong-chinese.com/media), you can find lots of videos to watch and audio to listen to in Chinese. Now you can add your own videos and audio to study.

Once you go to the media page, tap the My media section.

There, you can choose any YouTube video or upload any audio file and add a transcript to read along with it.

Once you've done that, you can see what percentage of the text you can understand, and look up words that you don't know.

I have been taking [online Chinese classes from GoEast Mandarin](https://goeastmandarin.com/online/) and have been using this feature myself to study the texts that my teacher sends me.

Of course, if you don't have anything to upload yourself, you can still watch media with transcripts that Dong Chinese has already gathered:
