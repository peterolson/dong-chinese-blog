The data powering the dictionary on Dong Chinese is now available to the public on the [Chinese Character Wiki](https://www.dong-chinese.com/wiki). The wiki contains breakdowns and explanations of the origins of the 1000 most common characters in Chinese books and movies. If you ever see any errors or things that can be improved on the Dong Chinese dictionary, you can suggest edits on the wiki. All of the data is free to download.
