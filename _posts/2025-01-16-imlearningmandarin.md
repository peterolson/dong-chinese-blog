title: "I'm Learning Mandarin Podcast"

I was interviewed on the [I'm Learning Mandarin podcast](https://imlearningmandarin.com/2025/01/15/learning-mandarin-with-dong-chinese-podcast/) by Mischa Wilmers. We talked about my background, why I decided to learn Chinese, and what led me to create Dong Chinese.

Mischa interviews many people from different backgrounds who are learning Mandarin, so I recommend checking out his other episodes as well at [https://imlearningmandarin.com/](https://imlearningmandarin.com/).
