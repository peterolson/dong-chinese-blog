### The three most gruesome characters

1. **黑** (hēi; black) - represents a permanent tattoo on the face to mark someone as a criminal  
   (See [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Pu...](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Punishments))

2. **取** (qǔ; take) - represents a hand grabbing an ear cut off a defeated enemy to use as a battle trophy
  
3. **央** (yāng; beg) - represents a man inside a torture device called a cangue (木枷) that prevents him from reaching his mouth with his hand, and thus being compelled to beg others to feed him  
   (See [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cangue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cangue))

Note that nowadays these are completely normal characters used in context in non-gruesome ways, such as:

 - 那只猫是**黑**色的。  
   That cat is **black**.
     
 - 我来**取**我的自行车。  
   I'm here to **pick up** my bike.
     
 - 我**央**你一件事。  
   I'd **ask** a favor of you.
